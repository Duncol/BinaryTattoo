# BinaryTattoo
Transform text into it's binary representation (ASCII) in many ways with this lovely little cmd line tool!

# Usage
* '-i' (required) - input to be binarized (string; might some wise sentence, like 'I never don't give up')
* '-s' (optional) - separator you want to use in between the binary words (I discourage to use '0' or '1', for obvious reasons). Defaults to ' ' (single space)
* '-d' (optional) - the direction in which the binarized tattoo will be printed. Available options in 2D world are: 'HORIZONTAL' and 'VERTICAL'. Sorry non-euclideans...

Have any suggestions? Well, I don't care, this is my baby and I will implement only the things I want (or even less, due to procrastination)
